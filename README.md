# Funko Locator API

This is the api that will support the Funko<sup>[1]</sup> Locator

## What is the Funko Locator

The Funko Locator is web system that will help Funko lovers to find Funko for sale everywhere in the world. The idea is based on the [bricklink.com]<sup>[2]</sup> does for Lego<sup>[2]</sup>.

For the first milestone we want to be able to integrate to all stores around the world and show their available Funkos and then the client can buy directly from the store.

The second milestone consists of the system being able to sell the items directly allowing even stores that don't have e-commerce capabilities to sell their Funkos world wide.
